        <h2>Cos&#39;è l&#39;Open Data Day?</h2>
        <p>L'Open Data Day è una festa dei dati aperti organizzata ogni anno a livello mondiale. Per la quinta volta, gruppi da tutto il mondo creeranno degli eventi locali in cui useranno dati aperti nelle proprie comunità. È un'opportunità per mostrare i vantaggi dei dati aperti e incoraggiarne l'adozione nel governo, nell'impresa e nella società civile.</p>

        
        <p>Tutti i risultati sono aperti e disponibili a tutti per essere usati e riusati.</p>

      <h3>Idee e sorgenti dati</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Ehi, appassionato di dati aperti! Hai appena visto che l'Open Data Day sarà sabato 3 marzo 2018 e vorresti organizzare un evento nella tua località. Il tuo unico problema ora è trovare l'idea giusta per toccare il tasto giusto. I nostri amici dalla comunità dei dati aperti hanno qualche idea e qualche sorgente dati che potrebbero interessarti.</p>

        <span class="theme">
          <h4>data.world</h4>
          <p>Usa <a href="https://data.world">data.world</a> per caricare o trovare dati da tante sorgenti e organizzare tutti gli aspetti di un progetto - inclusi dati, appunti, analisi e discussioni - in un solo spazio di lavoro. Collabora efficientemente usando diversi strumenti: interroga la base dati con SQL, interagisci con i dati con R Studio o con programmi Python usando le API di data.world, collega un Google Sheet a un dataset o lavora localmente su un foglio di calcolo e poi carica il file. Dopo l'Open Data Day, questo lavoro verrà conservato per mostrare cosa è stato fatto e permettere alla comunità di costruire sul lavoro già fatto senza dover ripetere la preparazione e l'analisi completata durante l'evento.</p>

        </span>
