1. Yelloworking, a transparent coworking space, will open all its financial data and will ask participants to find best ways to visualize them for its website. 
2. Those more into open hardware and open source can join a workshop in which an Arduino board will be used to hack the coffee machine in order to open in real time data about the coffee consumption of the coworking space. This will provide an instant snapshot of the activity at Yelloworking.
3. The local collective, PourAix.fr (http://pouraix.fr/#opendata), will hold a workshop in which attendees will geolocalize all decisions in the city council's minutes.
